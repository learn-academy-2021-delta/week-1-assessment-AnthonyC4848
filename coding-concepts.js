// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding conceptual questions
//    |  KEEP IN MIND THE COMPUTER COUNTS 012345... |
// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------1) What will this log?

var cohort = "Delta 2021"
console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: the outcome will be "10"
// b) Verify and explain: The/my outcome is "10" due to .length logs the amount of character spaces in the string.


// --------------------2) What will this log?

var greeting = "Hello World!"
console.log(greeting[3])

// a) Your answer: This will log "Hello World"
// b) Verify and explain: The outcome is "l" because it is logging the character in the 3rd slot of the string with [3] after the cariable (technically the 4th). This will allow you to call on specific characters in a string.


// --------------------3) What will this log?

var languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
var index = 1
console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: This will log "Ruby"
// b) Verify and explain: This logs "Ruby" because the variable languages in an array. An array displays the whole string as one character. By calling on the string in the 1 slot you will get the second string in the array. Ruby!


// --------------------4) What will this log?

var weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer:
// b) Verify and explain:


// --------------------5) What will this log?

var dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: Number
// b) Verify and explain: The typeof command tells tells you the value of what is in the string. By using .length you are logging the amount of characters in the array. The type of will notice this is a number and log number.(:
